# PyPortal-Tesla-SOC-Monitor
Monitor the state of charge of the battery without using the app in your phone.

The PyPortal Tesla SOC Monitor is written using CircuitPython and uses the un-official Tesla API to grab the JSON data sent from the car and display the SOC level, charging status, and whether the vehicle is asleep or not.
